# Comparison of Clustering Algorithms for rule extraction from a RNN  

This repository contains the code which is part of a paper that was written for a seminar at the Otto-Firedrich-University of Bamberg.  
The aim of this study was to compare the quality of an equipartition and a k-means algorithm that was applied to a RNN.
Latter was trained on a modified Reber grammar.
